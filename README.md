# PanGallery

At present it's just a test to see if I could make the basic panning navigation
work right. Success on that front.

## To Do

Well, first thing is to make it useful in some way, so it can display actual
images and handle the clicking etc.

Second, the code requires entering the size of the thumbnails' margins manually,
which is not terribly convenient for maintenance. Need to fix that.

## Demo

I've set up a [demo page] on my site if you want to see what it looks like
before investigating further.
